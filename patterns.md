## _Behavioural patterns_

### Strategy pattern
The strategy pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.

### State pattern
The state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is close to the concept of finite-state machines.

### Observer pattern
The observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically. The object which is being watched is called the subject. The objects which are watching the state changes are called observers or listeners.

### Iterator pattern
The iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.

### Visitor pattern
The visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying the structures.

## _Structural patterns_

### Composite pattern
The composite pattern describes a group of objects that are treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

### Adapter pattern
The adapter pattern is a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

### Decorator pattern
The decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

dynamically = run time

## _Creation patterns_

### Factory method pattern
The factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.

### Abstract factory pattern
The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.


### Builder pattern
The builder pattern is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.

### Singleton pattern
The singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
