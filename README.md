Object Oriented programming notes. This README only includes basic notes.

## Design patterns
### Structural:
As its name implies, it provides a framework as to how code should be structured to fit within the constraints of good design. There are no specific implementations and it serves as a guideline more than a strict instruction set.

Example patterns:
- Adapter
- Composite
- Decorator

### Behavioural:
Behavioural patterns structural patterns a step further and enforce a stricter ruleset in terms of how the pattern should be implemented. This manifests in the form of required methods and classes. An example of this is the `notifyAll()` methods often found within the subject class in observer patterns. The pattern would not be complete without the subject being able to notify its observers of changes.

Example patterns:
- Iterator
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template
- Visitor

### Creational patterns
Creational patterns mainly relate to the mechanism we use to create instantiate objects.

Example patterns:
- Factory
- Abstract factory
- Builder
- Singleton
